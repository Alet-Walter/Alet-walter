- ğŸ‘‹ #Hey, Iâ€™m Walter
- I am very dynamic and open to all sorts of diversities which is exactly why I'm always leaning.
- ğŸ‘€ Currently Studying software engineering, a field I'm very passionate about and hence very self driven in all my endavours in the study

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m most comfortable in that weird,funky world between design and development-that's where the most fun,creative,boundary-breaking work happens.Very facinating.
